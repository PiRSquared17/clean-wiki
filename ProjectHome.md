# Clean Wiki #

Clean Wiki is a feature rich wiki designed to keep things simple, clean and small yet maintaining rich functionality. Our motto is **If it is complicated it is broken**.  Here are some of the key features:

  * Uses Rich Text (HTML) and **NOT** weired wiki syntax.
  * Focuses is placed on content.
  * Easily skinable.
  * **NO** database is required`*`.
  * Stores page history, view any version, and version diffs.
  * Allows page comments and administrator comment editing and deletion.
  * Advanced security options and permissions.
  * Extremely powerful search allows you to find anything.
  * Smart design allows extensions and flexibility.

`*` Wiki pages are stored as standard HTML files with an XML header that contains versions, comments, and permission information. Clean wiki is also design to allow easy integration of a database with minimal code changes.
