The purpose of Clean Wiki is to provide a small, simple, clean wiki yet maintain a feature rich environment. Here are some of the key features:

  * Wirtten in PHP.
  * Does NOT require a database.
  * Easily sinkable.
  * Page history and change log.
  * Page comments.
  * Page permissions.
  * Rich Text (HTML) and not Wiki syntax.

The goal is to keep it small. There are only a few files:

  * CleanWiki.php: contains the main wiki class and functionality.
  * index.php: the main wiki page that uses CleanWiki class to display the current page. Users can modify this html file to skin Clean Wiki.
  * script.js: client side javascript for rich text, drop down menu, etc.
  * styles.css: wiki skin styles.
  * security.xml: contains security group and user information.
