The purpose of Clean Wiki is to determine who small can we write a wiki yet maintain a feature rich environment. Here are some of the key starting points of Clean Wiki.

* Wirtten in PHP.
* Does NOT require a database.
* Easily sinkable.
* Provides change history log.
* Allows comments on pages.
* Provides page permissions.
* Uses Rich Text (HTML) and not Wiki syntax.

The goal is to keep it small. There are only a few files:

* CleanWiki.php: contains the main wiki class and functionality.
* index.php: the main wiki page that uses CleanWiki class to display the current page. Users can modify this html file to skin Clean Wiki.
* script.js: client side javascript for rich text, drop down menu, etc.
* styles.css: wiki skin styles.
* security.xml: contains security group and user information.
